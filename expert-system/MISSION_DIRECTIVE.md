# Mission Directive

## Global Goal

Build comprehensive knowledge base of Time Tracking Tool project (aka TTT aka Time Reporting Tool), generate test plans and test cases for all major features, and produce executable Playwright + TypeScript E2E autotests from the generated test documentation. Note that existing documentation can be incomplete / unclear and low-quality, therefore use codebase analysis (static) in combination with application exploration (dynamic) as final truth.

Note: (Mainly) use English version of application for exploratory analysis / testing; use English language in knowledge base; in cases of ambiguous/unclear terminology give Russian version of terms as well.

## Project Context

TTT is web application aimed for internal corporate tracking / processing / management of time usage by employees in different domains: 
* reports of hours spent for particular tasks;
* absences of different types: vacations, days-off, sick-leaves.

### Functionality

Different types of time-related data views:
* tables of different entities: reports, vacation requests, project members etc.;
* timecharts of absences (Availability chart);
* statistics view;
With search and filter options to get and display data of interest.

Processing (major areas):
* task addition / renaming;
* report of spent hours (editing / deletion);
* absence request creation / editing / deletion; 
* calculations of working hours: reported vs norm;
* calculations of vacation days: used vs available;
* confirmation and agreement of requests (vacation / day-off);
* confirmation of reported hours;
* accounting operations: periods change (per salary office), vacation payment etc.; 

Administration (major areas):
* projects;
* production calendars / salary offices;
* user's settings / trackers; 

Application UI and features depend on user's role. Roles: employee, contractor, manager, department manager, accountant, admin.

API integrations:
* other internal projects (e.g. Company Staff (aka CS) to get users and salary offices data);
* external trackers (JIRA, GitLab etc.)

Application uses cron jobs to trigger regular operations by time (e.g. synchronization with CS).

There are email notifications of different types.

UI has 2 language versions: Russian (RU) and English (EN). Language switcher is available in page header.

Note: This is brief information, some features/details may not be mentioned here due to size and complexity of project, feel free to investigate and include undescribed areas into knowledge base and generated test docs.

## Priority Areas

1. Absences
2. Reports
3. Accounting

### Designs
- **Figma project**: see skill figma-access
Use links to figma layers from GitLab tickets and Confluence pages

### Test Management
- **Qase project**: see skill qase-access
  - Note: Can be outdated, unclear, incomplete. Use along with other info sources with discretion

### Tickets
- **GitLab tickets**: https://gitlab.noveogroup.com/noveo-internal-tools/ttt-spring/-/boards (see skill gitlab-access)
  - Key labels: Sprint X, HotFix Sprint X, where X>=11 and X<=[current_sprint], ([current_sprint] number from config.yaml)
  - Note: try to define tasks/tickets with latest implementations; but for some areas older tickets can be useful.

### Additional Documents
- **Google Docs**: by links from Confluence pages and GitLab tickets (access by link, no mcp required)
- **Google Sheets**: by links from Confluence pages and GitLab tickets (access by link, no mcp required)

### Testing Environments
Use config/ttt/envs/* to get environment parameters, see skills: playwright-browser, postgres-db
- **Primary dev**: timemachine
- **Secondary dev**: qa-1
- **Primary prod**: stage
- Note: compare dev and prod versions to investigate changes in current Sprint
- **Playwright:** Use `playwright-vpn` MCP server (tools prefixed `mcp__playwright-vpn__`) for all UI exploration. The built-in Playwright plugin cannot reach VPN hosts. Load tools via `ToolSearch` before first use.
- List of swaggers available for each test environment (see skill swagger-api):
[envURL]/api/ttt/swagger-ui.html?urls.primaryName=api

## Output Requirements

### Phase B — XLSX Test Documentation
- Test plans as XLSX (one per major module/feature area)
- Test cases as XLSX (detailed, executable)
- Must include description how to generate input test data (by database mining with criteria, random generation in given range, timestamp addition, static values etc.)
- Can include UI, API and DB actions
- Compatible with Google Sheets import
- English only

### Phase C — Autotest Generation
- Executable Playwright + TypeScript E2E tests generated from XLSX test documentation
- Test code lives in `autotests/` directory, follows 5-layer architecture: test specs → fixtures → page objects → config+data → Playwright API
- XLSX test cases are parsed into a JSON manifest (`autotests/manifest/test-cases.json`) via `autotests/scripts/parse_xlsx.py`
- Each generated test must support three data modes: `static` (hardcoded defaults), `dynamic` (PostgreSQL queries for real data), `saved` (cached JSON for reproducibility)
- Tests are verified against live test environments (configured via `autotest.target_env` in config.yaml)
- Generation scope can be limited to a single module via `autotest.scope` in config.yaml
- Priority order follows the same order as Phase B (Absences → Reports → Accounting → Administration)
- Knowledge base (vault) must be consulted before generating each test — for selectors, validation rules, known UI quirks, and edge cases
- Use existing page objects and fixtures when possible; create new ones only when needed
- Track progress in SQLite `autotest_tracking` table
- Skills: autotest-generator, autotest-runner, autotest-fixer, xlsx-parser, autotest-progress, page-discoverer
