# Autonomy Mode Guide — Running the Expert System Unattended

> **Purpose:** Step-by-step guide for preparing, launching, monitoring, and managing the expert system in fully autonomous mode — where sessions run unattended via a shell loop.
>
> **Prerequisite:** The base expert system must already be set up per `docs/human-guide.md`. This guide covers only the autonomy-specific additions.
>
> **Billing:** This system is designed for the Claude MAX plan subscription. The MAX plan has a 5h token budget per usage window (~4.8 windows/day). The inter-session delay is tuned to consume ~64% of each window's budget, leaving headroom for interactive use.

## 1. How It Works

In autonomous mode, a shell script (`expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh`) launches sequential `claude -p` sessions. Each session:

1. Reads `CLAUDE.md` + `config.yaml` (autonomy.mode = "full")
2. Reads vault state (`_SESSION_BRIEFING.md`, `_INVESTIGATION_AGENDA.md`, etc.)
3. Picks top investigation items, executes them without waiting for human approval
4. Updates vault notes, SQLite, and coverage tracking
5. Exits

The master prompt lives in `CLAUDE+.md`. Claude Code only reads `CLAUDE.md` at session start. The project has two versions of `CLAUDE.md`:

- **Interactive mode** (default): `CLAUDE.md` is a lightweight file that points the agent to the knowledge base, MCPs, and search workflow. Used when a human runs `claude` directly.
- **Autonomous mode**: The runner backs up `CLAUDE.md` to `CLAUDE.md.interactive`, then symlinks `CLAUDE.md -> CLAUDE+.md` (the full autonomous protocol). On exit, the runner removes the symlink and restores the interactive version from backup.

This switching is automatic — no manual action needed.

The script captures exit codes, enforces stop conditions via timeout, and maintains a state file (`runner-state.json`) across sessions. Each session's stdout (JSON) and stderr (diagnostics) are written to separate files. After each session, vault changes are auto-committed to a local git repo for per-session history. Cross-session memory lives entirely in the vault and SQLite — each `claude -p` invocation is stateless.

## 2. Preparation Checklist

### 2.1 Verify Base Setup

Everything from `docs/human-guide.md` must be working:

```bash
# All must pass
claude --version
python3 -c "import yaml; print('pyyaml OK')"
qmd status
claude mcp list | head -5

# Verify playwright-vpn MCP (critical for UI exploration)
claude mcp get playwright-vpn
# If missing, see docs/playwright-mcp-fix.md

# Verify /etc/hosts has all TTT environments (critical for Swagger MCPs)
grep noveogroup /etc/hosts
# Must show entries for ALL environments in config.yaml:
#   10.0.4.220 ttt-qa-1.noveogroup.com
#   10.0.6.53  ttt-timemachine.noveogroup.com
#   10.0.4.241 ttt-stage.noveogroup.com
# If missing, add them — see docs/swagger-api-connection-fix.md
```

> **Adding a new environment?** After adding it to `config.yaml` and `config/ttt/envs/<name>.yml`, you **must manually** add its `/etc/hosts` entry (`sudo` required — the AI cannot do this). Without it, all Swagger and Playwright MCP calls to that environment will fail with `ENOTFOUND`. See `docs/swagger-api-connection-fix.md`.

### 2.2 Review config.yaml

The `autonomy` section in `expert-system/config.yaml` (showing defaults — adjust to your needs):

```yaml
autonomy:
  mode: "full"                       # "hybrid" or "full"
  max_sessions: 30                   # Stop after N sessions (0 = unlimited)
  consecutive_failure_limit: 3       # Abort after N consecutive failures
  auto_phase_transition: true        # Auto-switch to Phase B when coverage target met
  log_dir: "expert-system/logs"      # Session log directory
  stop: false                        # Set to true to gracefully stop after current session
  model: "opus"                      # Model for claude -p
  effort: "max"                      # Effort level
  allow_api_mutations: false         # If false, only GET/SELECT in autonomous mode
```

**Key decisions before first run:**

| Setting | Default | Consider changing if... |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| `max_sessions` | 30 | You want fewer/more sessions total |
| `allow_api_mutations` | false | You trust autonomous POST/PATCH/DELETE on test envs |
| `auto_phase_transition` | true | Set to false if you want manual Phase B transition |
| `model` | opus | You want to use a different model |
| `session.delay_minutes` | 70 | See §2.3 for tuning guidance |
| `session.delay_minutes_offhours` | 45 | Off-hours delay; see §2.3 |
| `session.offhours_utc` | 15:00-03:00 | UTC range for off-hours delay |

### 2.3 Session Delay and Token Budget

#### Understanding the budget model

The MAX plan has a **5h token budget per usage window** (not per day). There are approximately **4.8 usage windows per day** (24h / 5h). Each window's budget resets independently.

Empirically, **uninterrupted Claude Code work burns through the 5h token budget in ~2h20m of wall-clock time** (burn rate ~2.14x). This means each 30-min expert session consumes approximately 64 min of the 5h (300 min) token budget.

#### Sessions per usage window

| Sessions/window | Token consumption | % of 5h budget | Headroom for interactive use |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 128 min | 43% | 172 min (57%) |
| **3** | **193 min** | **64%** | **107 min (36%)** |
| 4 | 257 min | 86% | 43 min (14%) |
| 5 | 321 min | **exceeds budget** | — |

**Recommended: 3 sessions per window** — uses ~64% of budget, leaves headroom for interactive use.

#### Delay calculation

To fit N sessions evenly within a 5h (300 min) window:

```
cycle = 300 / N                    # minutes between session starts
delay = cycle - avg_session_time   # gap between sessions
```

| Target sessions/window | Cycle time | Delay (T=30min) | Sessions/day | Days for 100 sessions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 150 min | **120 min** | ~9.6 | ~10.4 |
| **3** | **100 min** | **70 min** | **~14.4** | **~6.9** |
| 4 | 75 min | 45 min | ~19.2 | ~5.2 |

The default `delay_minutes: 70` targets 3 sessions per usage window (~14 sessions/day, ~64% budget consumption).

#### Impact of session duration (delay = 70 min)

| Avg session | Sessions/window | Token consumption/window | Sessions/day | Days for 100 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 min | 3.5 | 96 min (32%) | ~17 | ~5.9 |
| 20 min | 3.3 | 129 min (43%) | ~16 | ~6.3 |
| **30 min** | **3.0** | **193 min (64%)** | **~14** | **~7.1** |
| 45 min | 2.6 | 241 min (80%) | ~12.5 | ~8.0 |
| 60 min | 2.3 | 308 min (**over!**) | ~11 | ~9.1 |

> **Warning:** If sessions average >50 min, the 70 min delay may exceed the window budget. Increase the delay or reduce session duration via `max_duration_minutes`.

#### Calibration after first sessions

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
with open('expert-system/logs/runner-state.json') as f:
    s = json.load(f)
durations = [sess['duration_sec']/60 for sess in s['sessions']]
avg = sum(durations) / len(durations)
print(f'Session durations (min): {[round(d,1) for d in durations]}')
print(f'Average: {avg:.0f} min')
print()
# Budget model: 5h (300 min) token window, burn rate 2.14x
for n in [2, 3, 4]:
    cycle = 300 / n
    delay = cycle - avg
    token_per_window = n * avg * 2.14
    pct = token_per_window / 300
    sessions_per_day = 1440 / (avg + max(delay, 0))
    status = 'OK' if pct < 0.9 else 'OVER BUDGET'
    print(f'{n} sessions/window: delay={delay:.0f} min, {pct:.0%} budget, ~{sessions_per_day:.0f}/day [{status}]')
"
```

Adjust `session.delay_minutes` in config.yaml — the runner re-reads it before each session.

#### Off-hours optimization

During non-working hours (default: 15:00–03:00 UTC), there's no need for interactive headroom. The runner automatically uses `delay_minutes_offhours` (45 min) instead of `delay_minutes` (70 min), fitting 4 sessions per window instead of 3.

| Period | Hours (UTC) | Delay | Sessions/window | Budget usage | Sessions in period |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Working | 03:00–15:00 | 70 min | 3 | 64% | ~7.2 |
| Off-hours | 15:00–03:00 | 45 min | 4 | 86% | ~9.6 |
| **Daily total** | — | — | — | — | **~16.8** |

The `offhours_utc` range in config.yaml uses `HH:MM-HH:MM` format (UTC). Overnight ranges (start > end) are handled correctly — e.g., `15:00-03:00` means hour >= 15 OR hour < 3.

### 2.5 Review MISSION_DIRECTIVE.md

The mission directive drives what the system investigates. Before unattended runs, ensure:
- Priority areas are correctly ordered
- Information source URLs are current
- Testing environment names match config.yaml

### 2.6 QMD Daemon

The runner's preflight check now auto-detects whether the QMD MCP daemon is running (via `pgrep -f "qmd.*mcp"`). If it's not running, the runner starts it automatically with `qmd mcp --http --daemon`. If auto-start fails, the runner continues with a warning — semantic search will be unavailable but sessions will still work.

For extra reliability, you can also keep QMD running persistently:

```bash
# Option A: tmux
tmux new -d -s qmd 'qmd mcp --http'

# Option B: ~/.bashrc auto-start
if ! pgrep -f "qmd.*mcp" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  qmd mcp --http --daemon
fi
```

### 2.7 Make the Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh
```

---

## 3. Starting the Runner

### 3.1 Dry Run (always do this first)

Preview what would happen without executing any Claude sessions:

```bash
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh --dry-run
```

This shows:
- CLAUDE.md backup and symlink creation (and restore on exit via trap)
- Preflight check results (including QMD daemon auto-start)
- Config values being used, including session timeout
- The exact prompt that would be sent to each session
- The `claude` command with timeout that would be executed

Review the bootstrap prompt (session 1) carefully. After the dry run exits, verify `CLAUDE.md` was restored to the interactive version: `ls -la CLAUDE.md` should show a regular file (not a symlink).

### 3.2 Single Session Test

Run just one session to verify everything works end-to-end:

```bash
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh --sessions 1
```

After it completes, verify:

```bash
# Session JSON output is valid
python3 -m json.tool "$(ls -t expert-system/logs/session-*.json | head -1)" > /dev/null

# Stderr log exists (may be empty if no warnings)
ls -la "$(ls -t expert-system/logs/session-*.stderr | head -1)"

# Runner log captured all output
cat expert-system/logs/runner.log

# State file updated
python3 -m json.tool expert-system/logs/runner-state.json

# CLAUDE.md restored to interactive version
ls -la CLAUDE.md  # should be a regular file, not a symlink

# Vault files were created
ls expert-system/vault/_SESSION_BRIEFING.md

# SQLite tables initialized
sqlite3 expert-system/analytics.db ".tables"

# Vault git commit recorded
git -C expert-system/vault log --oneline -1
```

### 3.3 Full Unattended Run

Run in a terminal multiplexer so it survives SSH disconnects:

```bash
# Option A: tmux
tmux new -s expert
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh
# Ctrl+B, D to detach — reconnect later with: tmux attach -t expert

# Option B: screen
screen -S expert
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh
# Ctrl+A, D to detach — reconnect later with: screen -r expert

# Option C: nohup (simplest, no reattach)
# Runner log is auto-persisted to expert-system/logs/runner.log
nohup ./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &
echo $! > expert-system/logs/runner.pid
```

### 3.4 Run a Specific Number of Sessions

```bash
# Run exactly 5 sessions then stop
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh --sessions 5
```

---

## 4. Monitoring

### 4.1 Live Output

**Runner log** — the runner's own timestamped messages (persisted automatically):

```bash
tail -f expert-system/logs/runner.log
```

**Current session stdout** (JSON output from Claude):

```bash
tail -f "$(ls -t expert-system/logs/session-*.json | head -1)"
```

**Current session stderr** (MCP warnings, Node.js errors, diagnostics):

```bash
tail -f "$(ls -t expert-system/logs/session-*.stderr | head -1)"
```

Session output is split into paired files: `session-001-*.json` (clean JSON) + `session-001-*.stderr` (diagnostics). This prevents MCP warnings from corrupting the JSON output.

### 4.2 Runner State

Check overall progress:

```bash
cat expert-system/logs/runner-state.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

Shows: current session number, consecutive failures, and per-session history (timestamp, exit code, duration).

Quick summary:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
with open('expert-system/logs/runner-state.json') as f:
    s = json.load(f)
print(f'Sessions completed: {s[\"session_number\"]}')
print(f'Consecutive failures: {s[\"consecutive_failures\"]}')
if s['sessions']:
    last = s['sessions'][-1]
    print(f'Last session: #{last[\"session\"]} at {last[\"timestamp\"]} (exit {last[\"exit_code\"]}, {last[\"duration_sec\"]}s)')
"
```

### 4.3 Knowledge Progress

**Vault briefing** — what the system did and plans to do next:

```bash
# Via Obsidian: open _SESSION_BRIEFING.md
# Via terminal:
cat expert-system/vault/_SESSION_BRIEFING.md
```

**Coverage** — how much of the codebase has been investigated:

```bash
cat expert-system/vault/_KNOWLEDGE_COVERAGE.md
```

**Agenda** — what's planned for upcoming sessions:

```bash
cat expert-system/vault/_INVESTIGATION_AGENDA.md
```

**Vault size** — how many notes have been created:

```bash
find expert-system/vault -name "*.md" | wc -l
find expert-system/vault -name "*.md" -newer expert-system/vault/_SESSION_BRIEFING.md
```

**Vault history** — what each session contributed (via per-session git commits):

```bash
git -C expert-system/vault log --oneline --stat
```

### 4.4 SQLite Metrics

```bash
sqlite3 expert-system/analytics.db "
  SELECT 'Notes analyzed' as metric, count(*) as value FROM analysis_runs
  UNION ALL SELECT 'Modules tracked', count(*) FROM module_health
  UNION ALL SELECT 'Design issues', count(*) FROM design_issues
  UNION ALL SELECT 'External refs', count(*) FROM external_refs
  UNION ALL SELECT 'Exploration findings', count(*) FROM exploration_findings;
"
```

### 4.5 Coverage Report

Run the coverage estimation script for a comprehensive Phase A dashboard:

```bash
./expert-system/scripts/coverage-report.sh
```

This queries SQLite + counts vault notes to produce:
- Module health completeness (rows with key fields filled)
- External refs by source type (Confluence, GitLab, Figma, Qase)
- Exploration findings by method (UI, API, DB)
- Vault note count by directory
- Wikilink density (average `[[...]]` links per note)
- Weighted composite score (target: >=80% for Phase A completion)

### 4.6 Obsidian Graph View

Open Obsidian with the vault at `expert-system/vault/`. The graph view shows how knowledge nodes are interconnected. A healthy knowledge base shows dense clusters, not isolated nodes.

---

## 5. Controlling the Runner

### 5.1 Graceful Stop

Set `autonomy.stop: true` in `config.yaml` — the runner finishes the current session, then exits:

```yaml
# expert-system/config.yaml
autonomy:
  stop: true   # was false
```

The runner re-reads config before each new session. Set it back to `false` to allow future runs.

### 5.2 Immediate Stop

Kill the runner process (the current Claude session will also terminate):

```bash
# If using tmux: Ctrl+C in the tmux session
# If using nohup:
kill $(cat expert-system/logs/runner.pid)
```

### 5.3 Pause and Resume

The runner automatically resumes from where it left off — `runner-state.json` tracks the session counter. Just stop the runner (gracefully or immediately) and start it again later:

```bash
# Stop: set autonomy.stop: true in config.yaml
# ... wait for current session to finish ...

# Resume: set autonomy.stop: false in config.yaml
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh
```

### 5.4 Adjust Mid-Run

You can edit `config.yaml` between sessions (the runner re-reads it before each session):

- **Change delay**: edit `session.delay_minutes` and/or `session.delay_minutes_offhours`
- **Switch to hybrid**: set `autonomy.mode: "hybrid"` — runner will abort at preflight
- **Enable Phase B**: set `phase.current: "generation"` and `phase.generation_allowed: true`
- **Allow mutations**: set `autonomy.allow_api_mutations: true`

You can also edit vault files between sessions:

- **Reprioritize**: edit `_INVESTIGATION_AGENDA.md` to change what gets investigated next
- **Add context**: add notes to the vault — the system discovers them via QMD
- **Redirect**: edit `_SESSION_BRIEFING.md` to leave instructions for the next session

### 5.5 Reset State

To start the session counter from scratch (e.g., after a failed first run):

```bash
rm expert-system/logs/runner-state.json
# Optionally clear old logs:
rm expert-system/logs/session-*.json expert-system/logs/session-*.stderr
rm expert-system/logs/runner.log
```

---

## 6. Stop Conditions

The runner stops automatically when any of these conditions is met:

| Condition | Default | How to change |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `autonomy.stop` is true | `false` | Set to `true` in config.yaml |
| Max sessions reached | 30 | `autonomy.max_sessions` in config.yaml or `--sessions N` flag |
| N consecutive failures | 3 | `autonomy.consecutive_failure_limit` in config.yaml |
| Session timeout | max_duration + 30 min | `session.max_duration_minutes` in config.yaml |

Set `max_sessions: 0` for unlimited sessions (will run until another condition triggers).

**Session timeout:** Each `claude -p` call is wrapped with `timeout`. If a session exceeds `max_duration_minutes + 30` minutes (grace period for cleanup), it's terminated with SIGTERM (then SIGKILL after 60s). Timed-out sessions count as failures (exit code 124) and increment the consecutive failure counter. The default `max_duration_minutes: 240` gives a hard timeout of 270 minutes.

**Completion notification:** When the runner finishes (for any reason), it logs the stop reason and sends a desktop notification via `notify-send` (non-fatal if unavailable). Useful when running in tmux for extended periods.

---

## 7. Safety Model

### What the system CAN do autonomously

- Read and analyze the local code clone
- Read documentation from Confluence, Figma, Qase (via MCP), and GitLab (via curl REST API with PAT — the GitLab MCP server exposes no tools on this CE 16.11 instance)
- Send GET requests to Swagger/API endpoints on testing environments
- Run SELECT queries on the PostgreSQL testing database
- Navigate and screenshot the UI via `playwright-vpn` MCP (the built-in Playwright plugin cannot reach VPN hosts — see `docs/playwright-mcp-fix.md`)
- Create and update vault notes
- Insert and update SQLite records
- Run QMD searches and embeddings

### What the system CANNOT do by default

- **No API mutations** — POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE are blocked unless `allow_api_mutations: true`
- **No database writes** — only SELECT queries
- **No production access** — testing environments only (enforced by MCP server config)
- **Phase B auto-start** — enabled by default (`auto_phase_transition: true`). Set to `false` to require manual transition

### Permission mode

The runner uses `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`. This is safe because:
- MCP servers enforce access boundaries (read-only DB, testing envs only)
- `allow_api_mutations: false` adds an additional prompt-level gate
- The system operates on a local code clone, not the live repository
- Vault writes are additive (notes), not destructive

If you prefer tighter control, you can switch to hybrid mode (`autonomy.mode: "hybrid"`) which requires human approval at every decision point.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

### Runner won't start

```
FATAL: autonomy.mode is 'hybrid', expected 'full'
```
Set `autonomy.mode: "full"` in config.yaml.

```
FATAL: python3 pyyaml not installed
```
Run: `pip3 install --break-system-packages pyyaml`

```
FATAL: claude CLI not found
```
Ensure Claude Code is installed and in PATH.

### CLAUDE.md handling

The runner automatically backs up the interactive `CLAUDE.md` before autonomous runs and restores it on exit. No manual intervention needed. If you see `CLAUDE.md.interactive` in the project root, the runner is currently active or was interrupted — it will be cleaned up on next runner exit or start.

### Sessions failing immediately

Check the session log and stderr:

```bash
# JSON output (may be truncated if claude crashed)
python3 -m json.tool "$(ls -t expert-system/logs/session-*.json | head -1)"

# Stderr (MCP errors, Node.js crashes, etc.)
cat "$(ls -t expert-system/logs/session-*.stderr | head -1)"
```

Common causes:
- **QMD daemon not running**: runner auto-starts it, but check `pgrep -f "qmd.*mcp"`
- **MCP server crashed**: `claude mcp list` to check, restart as needed

### Proxy / VPN drops causing timeouts

Claude Code requires `HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:2080` (AdGuard VPN in SOCKS mode). If the VPN drops mid-session, the `claude -p` process hangs on API calls until the 270-min timeout kills it.

**Prevention:** A cron-based watchdog checks the proxy every 3 minutes and restarts the VPN if it's down:

```bash
# Add to crontab (crontab -e):
*/3 * * * * /home/v/Dev/ttt-expert-v1/expert-system/scripts/proxy-watchdog.sh >> /home/v/Dev/ttt-expert-v1/expert-system/logs/proxy-watchdog.log 2>&1
```

The watchdog script (`expert-system/scripts/proxy-watchdog.sh`) tests connectivity through the proxy and runs `adguardvpn-cli disconnect && adguardvpn-cli connect -l FI` on failure. Logs only appear when a restart was needed.

**Diagnosis:** If you see a session timeout in `runner-state.json`, check if the proxy was down at that time:

```bash
# Timed-out sessions
python3 -c "
import json
with open('expert-system/logs/runner-state.json') as f:
    s = json.load(f)
for sess in s['sessions']:
    if sess['exit_code'] == 124:
        print(f'Session {sess[\"session\"]}: TIMED OUT at {sess[\"timestamp\"]}')
"

# Proxy restart events around that time
grep "Proxy" expert-system/logs/proxy-watchdog.log
```

### Sessions timing out

If sessions consistently hit the timeout (exit code 124), check:
- `max_duration_minutes` in config.yaml — increase if sessions legitimately need more time
- The stderr file for hung MCP calls or infinite loops
- Whether an MCP server is unresponsive (e.g., VPN disconnected)
- Whether the proxy was down (see "Proxy / VPN drops" above)

```bash
# Find timed-out sessions
python3 -c "
import json
with open('expert-system/logs/runner-state.json') as f:
    s = json.load(f)
for sess in s['sessions']:
    if sess['exit_code'] == 124:
        print(f'Session {sess[\"session\"]}: TIMED OUT at {sess[\"timestamp\"]} ({sess[\"duration_sec\"]}s)')
"
```

### Consecutive failure limit hit

```bash
# Check what failed
python3 -c "
import json
with open('expert-system/logs/runner-state.json') as f:
    s = json.load(f)
for sess in s['sessions'][-5:]:
    print(f'Session {sess[\"session\"]}: exit={sess[\"exit_code\"]} duration={sess[\"duration_sec\"]}s')
"
```

Fix the underlying issue, then either:
- Reset the failure counter by editing `runner-state.json` (set `consecutive_failures: 0`)
- Or delete `runner-state.json` and restart (loses session history)

### No UI exploration happening

Sessions skip Playwright entirely if `playwright-vpn` MCP isn't registered or fails to start:

```bash
# Verify registration
claude mcp get playwright-vpn

# If missing, register it (see docs/playwright-mcp-fix.md):
npm install --prefix .claude/mcp-tools @playwright/mcp
claude mcp add-json playwright-vpn '{
  "command": "/usr/local/bin/node",
  "args": [
    ".claude/mcp-tools/node_modules/@playwright/mcp/cli.js",
    "--browser", "chrome", "--headless", "--no-sandbox",
    "--ignore-https-errors", "--proxy-bypass", "*.noveogroup.com",
    "--viewport-size", "1280x720"
  ],
  "env": { "HTTP_PROXY": "", "HTTPS_PROXY": "", "NO_PROXY": "*.noveogroup.com" }
}' --scope local
```

**Important:** Do NOT use the built-in Playwright plugin (`playwright@claude-plugins-official`) for TTT environments — it inherits `HTTP_PROXY` and gets 502/ERR_CONNECTION_RESET on all VPN hosts.

### Sessions producing no vault updates

- Check that mcp-obsidian is registered: `claude mcp get obsidian`
- Check vault permissions: `ls -la expert-system/vault/`
- Read the session log for errors

## 9. Typical Workflow

### Day 1: Bootstrap and Orientation

```bash
# Verify setup, dry run, single session test
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh --dry-run
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh --sessions 1

# Review results in Obsidian, check SQLite
# Adjust MISSION_DIRECTIVE.md if needed
# Check actual session duration, adjust delay_minutes if needed

# Run 3-5 more sessions for orientation
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh --sessions 5
```

### Days 2-5: Deep Investigation

```bash
# At ~14 sessions/day, 100 sessions take ~7 days
tmux new -s expert
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh

# Monitor daily:
cat expert-system/logs/runner-state.json | python3 -m json.tool
cat expert-system/vault/_KNOWLEDGE_COVERAGE.md
./expert-system/scripts/coverage-report.sh
```

### Days 5-7+: Coverage Review and Phase B

Run the coverage report to assess Phase A readiness:

```bash
./expert-system/scripts/coverage-report.sh
```

**Phase A is complete when:**
- Composite score >= 80%
- Note growth rate has plateaued (<2 new notes/session for 3+ consecutive sessions)
- All priority modules (absences, reports, accounting, administration) have entries
- All 4 source types represented in external_refs (Confluence, GitLab, Figma, Qase)
- All 3 exploration methods used (UI, API, DB)

You can also track per-session contributions via vault git history:

```bash
git -C expert-system/vault log --oneline --stat
```

```bash
# If coverage is sufficient, enable Phase B:
# Edit config.yaml:
#   phase.current: "generation"
#   phase.generation_allowed: true

# Run generation sessions
./expert-system/scripts/run-sessions.sh --sessions 10
```
