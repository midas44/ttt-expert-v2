  Automate browser interactions on the TTT and CS environments (and other web apps) using
  Playwright — navigate pages, log in, click elements, fill forms, switch language,
  take screenshots, and more. Use this skill when the user asks to "open a page",
  "take a screenshot", "log in as user X", "test in the browser", "navigate to",
  "check the UI", "use Playwright", "browser test", "screenshot a page", or any task
  that requires controlling a real browser. Also use when the user mentions "playwright",
  "headless browser", "browser automation", "open TTT", "login to TTT", "open CS",
  "login to CS", "Company Staff UI", "screenshot",
  or asks to visually verify a page. Covers both the Playwright MCP plugin (for simple
  public-site interactions) and standalone Node.js scripts (for VPN/proxy-restricted sites).

# Playwright Browser Automation

**Scope:**
- TTT: full
- CS: full (UI access via the same `playwright-vpn` MCP — CS is also behind the corporate VPN)

This skill provides instructions for automating browser interactions using Playwright,
with special handling for the TTT and CS environments behind VPN.

## Targeting CS (Company Staff)

CS is the secondary integrated SUT. UI is the only available access surface. Key facts:

- Base URL pattern: `https://cs-<env>.noveogroup.com` — currently only `preprod`. Get the resolved URL from `config/cs/cs.yaml` (`appUrl` template) or read it from `e2e/config/cs/csConfig.ts` if running inside the autotest framework.
- Auth: CAS SSO at `cas-demo.noveogroup.com` — same as TTT. **If the same browser context already has a TTT session via CAS, the CS login form is short-circuited** (the page redirects straight to CS dashboard). For deterministic behavior in cross-project scripts, open a separate `BrowserContext` per app (`browser.newContext()`).
- Credentials: see `config/cs/envs/preprod.yaml` (default `slebedev` / `slebedev`).
- Path inventory (from `config/cs/cs.yaml`): `/preferences`, `/employee/active/list`, `/contractors?tab=active`, `/settings/salary-office?tab=list`.

When the user asks to "log in to CS", use the CS appUrl + the slebedev credentials and check for the username input visibility before filling — the CAS short-circuit means the form may not appear.

### CS-specific gotchas (from live exploration 2026-04-15)

Knowledge deep-dive lives in the vault: `cs/_overview.md`, `cs/ui-automation-notes.md` + peers. TL;DR for automation:

1. **Switch UI language to English first, always.** Most CS accounts default to Russian, which produces Cyrillic snapshots. Go to `/preferences` → click the `English` radio directly (labels are ambiguous — there's an "English" text elsewhere that matches `getByText('English')` wrong) → remove InnovationLab popup (see #3) → click `Сохранить`/`Save`. Saved per-user, persistent. Recipe in `cs/ui-automation-notes.md`.

2. **CAS login button click often no-ops.** Use `HTMLFormElement.prototype.submit.call(form)` via `browser_evaluate` — the CS CAS form has an input named `submit` that shadows the form's native `submit()` method, and the Login `<button>` is not a true submit button. Filling username/password then calling the prototype submit works 100%.

3. **InnovationLab popup blocks action-button clicks.** A dismissable popup in the bottom-right on every page; it overlaps Save, Publish, and timeline controls. Remove it before any button click: `document.querySelectorAll('div').forEach(el => { if (el.textContent?.includes('InnovationLab') && el.textContent.length < 300) el.remove(); });`.

4. **Role switching requires context-level cookie clear.** CAS `/logout` drops the CAS ticket but the Symfony session cookie on CS is HttpOnly and survives — the next CS navigation silently re-auths as the previous user. Use `browser_run_code` with `await page.context().clearCookies()` before navigating back to CS.

5. **Masked phone input (`#phoneInput`) rejects JS-injected values.** Use Playwright `.fill()` with digits only (e.g. `79991234567`); the mask auto-formats to `+7(999)123-xx-xx`.

6. **Vue multiselect labels are frequently 2+ ancestors away from the dropdown.** Walk up 6 parents before giving up. See the `pickFromMultiselect` pattern in `cs/ui-automation-notes.md`.

7. **Pages open in new tabs.** The pencil/edit icon on the employee list opens `/profile/edit/<id>` in a new browser tab — use `browser_tabs action=select index=N` to switch.

8. **Username convention is idiosyncratic.** Logins are first-initial + last-name, but transliteration is bespoke — Pavel Weinmeister is `pvaynmaster`, not `pweinmeister`. To discover a user's login, search the employee list and read failed thumbnail URLs from console errors (`/api/thumbnail/<login>/400`).

## Three Approaches

| Approach | When to Use | Proxy/VPN Support |
|---|---|---|
| **`playwright-vpn` MCP server** (recommended) | All TTT environments, interactive exploration, autonomous sessions | Yes — proxy bypassed via env vars + `--proxy-bypass` flag |
| **Standalone Node.js script** | Complex multi-page flows, batch screenshots, custom Playwright API | Yes — unsets proxy env vars before launch |
| **Built-in Playwright MCP plugin** | Public sites only (no VPN) | No — inherits `HTTP_PROXY`, cannot bypass |

**Important:** The built-in Playwright MCP plugin (`playwright@claude-plugins-official`) inherits
the system `HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:2080` and provides no way to override it. VPN hosts
return **502 Bad Gateway** or **ERR_CONNECTION_RESET**. Use the `playwright-vpn` MCP server
instead — it has proxy bypass built in. See `docs/playwright-mcp-fix.md` for full details.

## 1. Standalone Script (Recommended for TTT)

### Prerequisites

Playwright must be installed as a local npm package:

```bash
npm list playwright 2>/dev/null || npm install --no-save playwright
```

The system Chrome (`google-chrome`) is used as the browser via `channel: 'chrome'`.

### Script Template

Use or adapt the bundled template at `scripts/ttt-template.mjs`:

```bash
node <skill-path>/scripts/ttt-template.mjs
```

### Key Patterns

#### Proxy Bypass (CRITICAL for VPN hosts)

Always unset proxy env vars at the top of the script, **before** any Playwright imports
are used to launch browsers:

```js
delete process.env.HTTP_PROXY;
delete process.env.HTTPS_PROXY;
delete process.env.http_proxy;
delete process.env.https_proxy;
```

#### Browser Launch

```js
const browser = await chromium.launch({
  headless: true,
  channel: 'chrome'   // uses system google-chrome
});

const context = await browser.newContext({
  viewport: { width: 1440, height: 900 },
  ignoreHTTPSErrors: true
});

const page = await context.newPage();
```

#### TTT Login (Login-Only Auth, No Password)

The TTT QA login page has a single `Login` field and a `LOGIN` button — no password.

```js
await page.goto('https://ttt-qa-1.noveogroup.com', { waitUntil: 'networkidle', timeout: 30000 });
await page.fill('#username', '<login>');
await Promise.all([
  page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: 'networkidle', timeout: 30000 }),
  page.click('button[type="submit"]')
]);
// After login, URL should be /report (dashboard)
```

#### Switch Language (RU -> EN)

The nav bar shows "RU" as a dropdown. Click it, then click "EN":

```js
await page.locator('text=RU').first().click();
await page.waitForTimeout(500);
const enOption = page.locator('text=EN').first();
if (await enOption.isVisible({ timeout: 3000 }).catch(() => false)) {
  await enOption.click();
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle', { timeout: 15000 });
}
```

If already in English, the nav shows "EN" — skip this step or check first:

```js
const langText = await page.locator('.nav >> text=/^(RU|EN)$/').first().textContent();
if (langText === 'RU') { /* switch */ }
```

#### Navigate to Common Pages

| Page | URL Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard (My tasks) | `/report` | Default after login |
| My Vacations | `/vacation/my` | Redirects to `/vacation/my/my-vacation/OPENED` |
| Vacation Requests | `/vacation/request` | Shows pending vacation requests |
| Absence Calendar | via nav menu "Calendar of absences" dropdown | |
| Planner | `/planner` | |
| Confirmation | `/confirmation` | |

#### Take Screenshots

```js
await page.screenshot({
  path: 'artifacts/playwright/screenshot-name.png',
  fullPage: true
});
```

Always save to `artifacts/playwright/`. Create the directory first if needed.

#### Logout

```js
await page.goto('https://cas-demo.noveogroup.com/logout', {
  waitUntil: 'networkidle', timeout: 30000
});
```

The page should contain "Logout successful".

#### Error Handling

Always wrap in try/catch and take an error screenshot on failure:

```js
try {
  // ... steps ...
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'artifacts/playwright/error-screenshot.png', fullPage: true });
} finally {
  await browser.close();
}
```

## 2. playwright-vpn MCP Server (Recommended for TTT)

A standalone `@playwright/mcp` server registered with proxy bypass. Provides the same
interactive MCP tools as the built-in plugin but can reach VPN hosts.

### Setup

Already registered as `playwright-vpn` in local scope. If missing, see `docs/playwright-mcp-fix.md`.

### Available MCP Tools

All tools are prefixed with `mcp__playwright-vpn__`:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `browser_navigate` | Navigate to a URL |
| `browser_click` | Click an element by ref |
| `browser_fill_form` | Fill form fields |
| `browser_type` | Type text into focused element |
| `browser_press_key` | Press keyboard key |
| `browser_hover` | Hover over element |
| `browser_select_option` | Select dropdown option |
| `browser_snapshot` | Get page accessibility snapshot (preferred for actions) |
| `browser_take_screenshot` | Take screenshot |
| `browser_evaluate` | Run JS on page |
| `browser_run_code` | Run Playwright code snippet |
| `browser_wait_for` | Wait for condition |
| `browser_tabs` | List open tabs |
| `browser_close` | Close current page |
| `browser_console_messages` | Get console output |
| `browser_network_requests` | Get network requests |
| `browser_navigate_back` | Go back |
| `browser_resize` | Resize viewport |
| `browser_drag` | Drag element |
| `browser_file_upload` | Upload file |
| `browser_handle_dialog` | Handle alert/confirm dialog |

Tools must be loaded via `ToolSearch` before first use:

```
ToolSearch: select:mcp__playwright-vpn__browser_navigate
```

### Usage Pattern

```
1. ToolSearch: select:mcp__playwright-vpn__browser_navigate,mcp__playwright-vpn__browser_snapshot
2. browser_navigate → URL
3. browser_snapshot → get element refs
4. browser_click / browser_fill_form → interact by ref
5. browser_take_screenshot → capture evidence
```

## 3. Built-in Playwright MCP Plugin (Public Sites Only)

The built-in plugin (`playwright@claude-plugins-official`) is only useful for public
websites. **Cannot reach VPN hosts** — returns 502/ERR_CONNECTION_RESET.

Tools prefixed with `mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__`. Same tool names as above.

Use `playwright-vpn` instead for all TTT work.

---

## TTT Environment Reference

| Env | URL | Status |
|---|---|---|
| QA-1 | `https://ttt-qa-1.noveogroup.com` | Dev test environment |
| Timemachine | `https://ttt-timemachine.noveogroup.com` | Dev test environment (CAS login) |
| Stage | `https://ttt-stage.noveogroup.com` | Pre-prod test environment |

Config files: `config/ttt/ttt.yml`, `config/ttt/envs/<name>.yml`

CAS logout URL: `https://cas-demo.noveogroup.com/logout`

---

## Output Directory

Save all Playwright artifacts to:
```
artifacts/playwright/
```

Use descriptive filenames:
```
artifacts/playwright/<user>-<page>-<date>.png
```

Example: `atushov-vacations-2026-02-27.png`

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 502 Bad Gateway on VPN host | Browser using HTTP_PROXY | Use `playwright-vpn` MCP server (not built-in plugin). See `docs/playwright-mcp-fix.md` |
| `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: playwright` | Not installed locally | `npm install --no-save playwright` |
| Login doesn't work (stays on login page) | Wrong selectors | Use `#username` for input, `button[type="submit"]` for button |
| Language switch doesn't work | EN already active or selector mismatch | Check if nav shows "RU" or "EN" first |
| Page content not loaded | SPA async loading | Add `page.waitForTimeout(2000)` or `waitForSelector` |
| MCP tool not found | Not loaded yet | Use `ToolSearch: select:mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__<tool>` |
| Screenshot is blank/login page | Session lost on navigation | Ensure cookies persist (use same context) |
| `channel: 'chrome'` fails | Chrome not installed | Check `which google-chrome` — fallback to `chromium` |
